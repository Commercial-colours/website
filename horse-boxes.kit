<h1>Horse box painting and repairs, North West and Wirral</h1>
<p>Our workshop in the Wirral can strip, prepare and paint any size of horse box into your paint-scheme or team colours, whether it&#8217;s a new build or secondhand box. We can help design new paint-schemes and graphics, and our sign writers can cut and apply silhouettes in every shapes and size.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>If your horsebox is damaged in an accident, we can liaise with your insurance company and undertake repairs. When needed, we will source parts from the original manufacturer or component suppliers and return the box to its original condition.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Older horse boxes</h2>

<p>We also cater for older boxes in need of refurbishment. Old panels can be repaired or fabricated in our shop, corroded areas can be cut-out and replaced, sub-structures and framework can be repaired or replaced, and cabs stripped down and refurbished.</p>

<h1>Paintwork and refurb&#8217;</h1>

<p>We cater for older and specialist vehicles in need of refurbishment. Vehicles can be stripped, repaired and modified prior to repainting into your fleet colours.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>We have a fully equipped shot blasting facility which is large enough to take the longest trailers, if your vehicle or machinery needs the chassis or equipment blasting this can be catered for in house.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Ready for the road</h2>

<p>We will liaise with your sign writers to re-decal your vehicle prior to its return, or our own sign writer can make and apply decals to your vehicle. Your vehicle will be returned ready for the road.</p>
